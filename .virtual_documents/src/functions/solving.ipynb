def pfba_Weighted(
    model, weightings=None, fraction_of_optimum=1.0, objective=None, reactions=None
):
    """Perform basic pFBA (parsimonious Enzyme Usage Flux Balance Analysis)
    to minimize total flux.
    pFBA [1] adds the minimization of all fluxes the the objective of the
    model. This approach is motivated by the idea that high fluxes have a
    higher enzyme turn-over and that since producing enzymes is costly,
    the cell will try to minimize overall flux while still maximizing the
    original objective function, e.g. the growth rate.

    ##### Parameters:
    model : cobra.Model
        The model
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Fraction of optimum which must be maintained. The original objective
        reaction is constrained to be greater than maximal_value *
        fraction_of_optimum.
    objective : dict or model.problem.Objective
        A desired objective to use during optimization in addition to the
        pFBA objective. Dictionaries (reaction as key, coefficient as value)
        can be used for linear objectives.
    reactions : iterable
        List of reactions or reaction identifiers. Implies `return_frame` to
        be true. Only return fluxes for the given reactions. Faster than
        fetching all fluxes if only a few are needed.

    ##### Returns:
    cobra.Solution

    The solution object to the optimized model with pFBA constraints added.

    """Determine the minimum and maximum flux value for each reaction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : cobra.Model
        The model for which to run the analysis. It will *not* be modified.
    reaction_list : list of cobra.Reaction or str, optional
        The reactions for which to obtain min/max fluxes. If None will use
        all reactions in the model (default None).
    loopless : bool, optional
        Whether to return only loopless solutions. This is significantly
        slower. Please also refer to the notes (default False).
    fraction_of_optimum : float, optional
        Must be <= 1.0. Requires that the objective value is at least the
        fraction times maximum objective value. A value of 0.85 for instance
        means that the objective has to be at least at 85% percent of its
        maximum (default 1.0).
    pfba_factor : float, optional
        Add an additional constraint to the model that requires the total sum
        of absolute fluxes must not be larger than this value times the
        smallest possible sum of absolute fluxes, i.e., by setting the value
        to 1.1 the total sum of absolute fluxes must not be more than
        10% larger than the pFBA solution. Since the pFBA solution is the
        one that optimally minimizes the total flux sum, the `pfba_factor`
        should, if set, be larger than one. Setting this value may lead to
        more realistic predictions of the effective flux bounds
        (default None).
    processes : int, optional
        The number of parallel processes to run. If not explicitly passed,
        will be set from the global configuration singleton (default None).

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        A data frame with reaction identifiers as the index and two columns:
        - maximum: indicating the highest possible flux
        - minimum: indicating the lowest possible flux

    Notes
    -----
    This implements the fast version as described in [1]_. Please note that
    the flux distribution containing all minimal/maximal fluxes does not have
    to be a feasible solution for the model. Fluxes are minimized/maximized
    individually and a single minimal flux might require all others to be
    sub-optimal.

    Using the loopless option will lead to a significant increase in
    computation time (about a factor of 100 for large models). However, the
    algorithm used here (see [2]_) is still more than 1000x faster than the
    "naive" version using `add_loopless(model)`. Also note that if you have
    included constraints that force a loop (for instance by setting all fluxes
    in a loop to be non-zero) this loop will be included in the solution.
