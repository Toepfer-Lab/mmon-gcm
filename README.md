## Installation

This code does not work with python 3.10 because of a dependency issue
with Escher: https://github.com/zakandrewking/escher/issues/377 . So
make sure you install the package in a venv with e.g. python 3.9.

1.  Clone the repo from GitHub.
2.  Make a venv with e.g. conda:
    `conda create --name mmon-gcm python=3.9`
3.  Install the package and dependencies in that virtualenv by running
    `pip install -e .` in the root of the repo
4.  Run the notebook scripts in the order that they are numbered.

The project uses nbdev2 to autocreate packages and documentation from
jupyter notebooks.
